Breast Cancer Clinical and Gene Expression Data Analysis
**Research Area :**

Is the cause of death in patients solely from cancer? Exploration of both genomic and clinical variables.

**Results :**

The dataset contains clinical variables and gene expression variables which after performing a dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis, the genomic variables were reduced significantly to capture only the most significant gene expressions for the analysis. The selected clinical variables contained numeric, binary, categorical, and ordinal variables and various techniques were performed on both clinical and genomic variables to explore their relationships including factor analysis, cluster analysis, correspondence analysis, and linear discriminant analysis.
Most commonly found cancer type is "Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma" which is captivating the rarest cancer type "Breast Invasive Mixed Mucinous Carcinoma". 
Regularized Regression over Overall Survival Years and Multinomial Logistic Regression over Death by Cancer were performed as final models.

**Conclusion :**

Exploration of the breast cancer gene expression dataset through the METABRIC database revealed key findings in relation to clinical and genomic variables and their significance in predicting the overall survival years in breast cancer patients.
Throughout our analysis the prominence of clinical variables with relation to the well-being of patients was clear.
This analysis just begins to scratch the surface of the work to be done with regards to breast cancer, but we hope that it can be a starting point for further analysis that can lead to a cure.
